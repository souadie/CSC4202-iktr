# Algorithm Analysis: Extended Graph Coloring Algorithm

## Time Complexity
The time complexity of the extended graph coloring algorithm can be quite high, potentially O((V*R*I)^V), where V is the number of vertices (exams), R is the number of rooms, and I is the number of instructors. This is due to the nested loops checking time slots, rooms, and instructors for each exam.

## Space Complexity
The space complexity is O(V + E + R + I), where V is the number of vertices (exams), E is the number of edges (conflicts), R is the number of rooms, and I is the number of instructors. This includes space for storing the graph, the room, and instructor availability, and the schedule.

## Performance
- *Best Case:* The algorithm performs well when there are enough rooms and instructors to easily meet all constraints.
- *Worst Case:* The algorithm struggles with limited resources (rooms and instructors) and high conflicts, leading to increased backtracking and computation time.

## Output Description
The output of the algorithm is a valid scheduling of the exams if a solution exists. Each exam is assigned a tuple (time_slot, room, instructor). For example, if the output is [(0, 101, 1), (1, 102, 2), (0, 101, 1), (1, 102, 2)], it means:
- Exam 0 and Exam 2 are scheduled in time slot 0 in room 101 with instructor 1.
- Exam 1 and Exam 3 are scheduled in time slot 1 in room 102 with instructor 2.

## Conclusion
The extended graph coloring algorithm is effective for solving the exam scheduling problem by modeling conflicts and assigning time slots, rooms, and instructors efficiently, although it may face performance challenges with high resource constraints.
