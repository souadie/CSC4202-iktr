# University Exam Scheduling Project
## Problem Description
**Introduction**: 
The university needs to organize the final exam schedule for all its courses at the end of the semester. This task involves assigning specific time slots and rooms for each exam while considering various constraints such as room availability, instructor schedules, and student enrollments.

**Problem Scenario Description**:
- **Input Data**:
  - A list of exams with their respective courses.
  - Availability and capacity of rooms.
  - Availability of instructors.
  - Enrollment data showing which students are taking which exams.
  - Specific requirements for certain exams (e.g., computer labs).
- **Constraints**:
  - No two exams can be scheduled in the same room at the same time.
  - Instructors can only assign to one exam at a time and must be available.
  - Students cannot have overlapping exams.
  - Specific requirements for certain exams (e.g., computer labs).
- **Objective**:
  - Create an exam timetable that minimizes conflicts and meets all constraints.

Importance of the Problem:

Resource Utilization: Efficient use of rooms and instructors, avoiding underuse or overuse of resources.
Logistical Efficiency: Streamlined operations for the university's administrative staff.
Fairness: Equitable scheduling for all students and instructors, avoiding biases and scheduling conflicts.
